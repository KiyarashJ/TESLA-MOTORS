        Desc : "The 2024 Tesla Cybertruck looks like it was dropped off by an alien race, but it's said to have the capabilities to challenge top-selling pickup trucks. With a sharp-edged stainless-steel body that's also apparently bulletproof, Tesla's electric truck looks seriously tough. Two trims are in the mix for 2024: a 600-hp dual-motor AWD model and an 845-hp tri-motor model called Cyberbeast. A single-motor rear-wheel drive Cybertruck is set to join the party sometime in 2025. Tesla claims the Cybertruck can tow up to 11,000 pounds and has an estimated driving range of up to 340 miles. Hooked up to a Tesla Supercharger, the EV truck can supposedly add between 128 and 136 miles of range in 15 minutes."

        Desc : "The original Tesla Roadster put the all-electric automaker on the map, even if most Model S and Model X buyers don't remember it. Originally slated to make its return in 2021, the new model hasn't yet hit the market, leading us to believe it's been delayed. The second-generation Roadster bests it predecessor by adding two small rear seats, significantly more driving range, and a much higher level of performance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasted about a 1.9-second 60-mph time and a 250-mph top speed when the Roadster concept was unveiled back in 2017â€”figures we very much hope will prove accurate when this sports car finally arrives."

        Desc : "The Model X has been a cornerstone of the Tesla lineup for years now, and the 2024 model remains an attention-grabbing electric SUV with unusual rear doors and lots of available technology. There are two models on offer, with a dual-motor Long Range starting off the range with 670 horsepower and 335 miles of estimated driving range. The performance-oriented Plaid model costs a lot more but makes a mighty 1020 horsepower and is said to be capable of driving up to 326 miles between charges. The Model X certainly impresses with straight-line acceleration, but when put next to newer luxury electric SUV offerings such as the BMW iX or the Rivian R1S, the Tesla's spartan interior and shoddy build quality are brought into sharp focus."
